# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a java Rock Paper Scissors game created during a course with the help of three group mates. Ayan Noorani and I were the major contributors for the programming aspect of the assignment.

The premise is simple: You agaisnt the computer in a one-on-one match of rock paper scissors.
Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock and scissors beats paper.

After each round, the winner will be awarded with a point. The first player to 5 points wins the game. If a round is tied, no points will be awarded.
The computer will be playing random moves up until the fourth round. After that, it will decide to play a random move or to use your previous moves to predict the outcome of the next round.

After a player wins a game, an end screen will be shown. The program will keep track of how many wins each player has by writing knew values to a .txt file each time a game is played.
This means that even after the program has been closed, it will be able to display the win statistics by reading the file the next time the program is opened.
